      question: "How do I get from Velana International Airport to my resort?",
      answer:
        "Most resorts arrange a shared or private speedboat transfer directly from the airport, typically taking well under an hour for nearby atolls. Resorts further away may use a seaplane or a domestic flight plus a shorter boat transfer — see the specific route below for your destination.",
    },

      question: "How do I reach a local island?",
      answer:
        "Local islands close to Malé, such as Maafushi, are reached by government ferry or a faster private speedboat service. See the Island Transfers page for real, individually priced routes.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does the journey take?",
      answer: "It depends entirely on the destination — nearby islands can be reached in well under an hour, while remote atolls may take longer or require a seaplane or domestic flight connection.",
