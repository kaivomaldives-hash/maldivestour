  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between a fishing charter and a fishing package?",
    answer: "A charter is the boat trip itself, for a half or full day. A package bundles a charter with accommodation, meals and transfers for a multi-night stay — see Fishing Packages below.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need fishing experience?",
    answer: "No — basic fishing gear and a professional captain and crew are included on every charter on this page, and traditional handline fishing needs no prior experience.",
  },
  {
    question: "What fish can I catch in the Maldives?",
    answer: "It depends on the technique and season — big game trips target tuna, wahoo, sailfish and marlin further offshore; reef and handline trips catch a wider range of reef species closer to shore. See Fishing by Technique below.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I combine fishing with a resort stay?",
    answer: "Yes — many resorts on this site (see Fishing by Technique and the activities below) run their own fishing trips alongside a normal resort stay, separate from the dedicated Maldives Fishing and Holiday packages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are prices on this page fixed?",
    answer: "Prices shown are the operator's current verified rate, subject to their own booking conditions — availability, fuel surcharges and operational costs can change rates without notice. Enquire to confirm before booking.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I catch giant trevally in the Maldives?",
    answer: "Yes — giant trevally are a common target for popping and jigging trips over channel edges and outer reef, including the Gaafu Atoll charters on this page. As with any wild fish, a catch isn't guaranteed on a given day.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is fishing available from local islands, not just resorts?",
    answer: "Yes — several charters on this page, including Maldives Fishing and Holiday's own Gaafu Atoll operation, are run from local islands rather than resorts, alongside independent Maafushi-based operators.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide fishing equipment?",

            Fishing has always been part of everyday life in the Maldives, long before tourism — and today it&rsquo;s one of the country&rsquo;s
            most genuine, least commercialized activities. Whether that means a traditional handline sunset trip taught by a local crew, a
            private full-day charter chasing tuna and wahoo further offshore, or a multi-night fishing holiday built entirely around the boat,
            real operators across the Maldives run real, bookable trips — not a generic &ldquo;fishing excursion&rdquo; add-on.
          </p>
          <p>
            This page covers two distinct things travelers search for. A <strong>fishing charter</strong> is the boat trip itself — a half day
            or full day, usually priced per boat rather than per person. A <strong>fishing package</strong> bundles a charter with
            accommodation, meals and transfers into a complete multi-night holiday. Both are represented here with real, currently-verified
            pricing from Maldives Fishing and Holiday Pvt Ltd&rsquo;s own rate sheet (valid until 31 December 2027), alongside individually
            sourced trips from resort dive/watersports centres and independent Maafushi and Malé-area operators.

        {/* Fishing in the Maldives — geography/context overview, the
            broad-topic coverage a pillar page needs beyond the charter/
            package listings below. */}
        <section className="mt-12 border-t border-neutral-200 pt-10">

            <p>
              The Maldives is built from 26 natural atolls — rings of reef enclosing shallow lagoons, cut through by
              channels (locally, <em>kandu</em>) where the tide pushes bait and predators between the inner lagoon and
              the open ocean. That structure is what makes the fishing here varied rather than one single thing: reef
              flats and channel mouths for light tackle close to shore, outer reef drop-offs where the coral gives way
              to deep water, and open ocean beyond the atoll rim for trolling further out.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fishing has been part of daily life here for longer than tourism has existed — handline fishing off a
              local dhoni is still how many Maldivian families put food on the table, and it&rsquo;s also the
              technique most sunset trips teach visitors with no prior experience. Sport and big game fishing grew up
              alongside that tradition rather than replacing it, and most operators on this page — resort-based and
              independent — run both styles.

            <p>
              The Maldives sits close enough to the equator that temperature barely changes year-round — what shifts
              is the monsoon, and with it sea conditions. The northeast monsoon (roughly December to April) brings
              calmer seas and clearer water, generally easier conditions for trolling and offshore trips. The
              southwest monsoon (roughly May to November) brings rougher water and more rain, though it can also
              stir up baitfish activity that some techniques benefit from.
            </p>
            <p>
              There isn&rsquo;t one single best month for every kind of fishing — a calm-water technique like
              trolling for tuna and wahoo can be productive through the northeast monsoon, while channel and reef
              fishing depend more on tide and current than on the season itself. Conditions vary year to year too, so
              treat any seasonal guidance as a general pattern rather than a guarantee.

              Most operators on this page practice catch and release for anything not being kept for the table,
              handling fish carefully to give them the best chance after release — wet hands, minimal time out of the
              water, and a quick, careful unhooking. Anchoring away from live coral and following the crew&rsquo;s
              lead on where fishing is and isn&rsquo;t appropriate near a given island protects the same reefs the
              fishing itself depends on.

              Rules and protected areas vary by atoll and can change — your operator&rsquo;s crew is the right source
