 * Physical surf breaks are represented as `locations` rows
 * (location_type = 'surf_break', already supported by the architecture
 * since Task 3 — no schema change). Break-specific descriptive facts
 * (wave characteristics, season, access) live in `nodes.attributes` JSONB,
 * per the architecture's JSONB-boundaries rule (genuinely flexible,
 * category-specific descriptive attributes, not core relational data).
 * They are deliberately NOT `activities` — a break is a place, not a
 * commercial product (see docs/SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE_AND_DATABASE_DESIGN.md
 * §10 and the Task 8/9 briefs).
